                <h2>JOHN AIVAN B. DIONISIO</h2>
                <p>I am currently serving God by being a good leader and a good son and student. I was born into a Christian family and have been serving God ever since I can remember. I have always strived to be a good leader and a good example to others. I have been a good student throughout my schooling and have always tried to do my best. I am currently serving God as a youth leader in our church. I have always felt called to serve God and help others, and I believe that being a youth leader will allow me to do just that. I am excited to see what the future holds and to continue serving God in whatever capacity He calls me to.</p>

                <p>So many times we say that we can't serve God because we aren't whatever is needed. We're not talented enough or smart enough or whatever. But if you are in covenant with Jesus Christ, He is responsible for covering your weaknesses, for being your strength. He will give you His abilities for your disabilities.</p>
